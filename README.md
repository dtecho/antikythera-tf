Antikythera Federated Transformer

Implementing a federated transformer of transformers with the Antikythera topology, complete with feedback loops and attention head arrays reflecting the gear ratio steps and perspectives of celestial bodies, requires a dynamic system. Below, I’ll outline how to construct such a model conceptually and technically.

Concept: Federated Transformer of Transformers

This design is a hierarchical system where:

1. Federation: Each transformer is a specialized submodel (representing a celestial body or system).


2. Topology: The federated structure matches the Antikythera mechanism's gear hierarchy and connectivity (e.g., ratios, dependencies, and perspectives).


3. Feedback Loops: Information flows between layers or gears cyclically to reflect continuous dynamics.


4. Attention Head Arrays: Arrays encode relationships such as rotations, alignments, and interactions of the celestial bodies.


5. Transformer of Transformers: Each gear or celestial body is itself modeled as a transformer, interacting with others in a hierarchical or networked manner.

Step 1: Model the Antikythera Topology as a Graph

The Antikythera mechanism is inherently a graph (or hypergraph) where:

Nodes = Gears/Celestial Bodies.

Edges = Relationships (e.g., dependencies or ratios between gears).

Properties = Gear ratios, feedback dynamics, and observational perspectives.


Graph Representation

import networkx as nx

# Create a directed graph for the Antikythera mechanism
graph = nx.DiGraph()

# Add gears/celestial bodies as nodes with properties
graph.add_node("Sun", gear_ratio=1, perspective="center")
graph.add_node("Moon", gear_ratio=13.368, perspective="lunar")
graph.add_node("Mars", gear_ratio=1.8808, perspective="martian")

# Add relationships (edges) between gears
graph.add_edge("Sun", "Moon", ratio=13.368)
graph.add_edge("Sun", "Mars", ratio=1.8808)

# Visualize relationships
print(graph.nodes(data=True))
print(graph.edges(data=True))


---

Step 2: Federated Transformer Design

Each gear (or celestial body) is a transformer, with parameters and architecture influenced by the gear's role in the system:

1. Input Embeddings: Encodes the state of the celestial body (e.g., position, velocity, and time step).


2. Attention Heads: Define interactions between this gear and others (e.g., based on gear ratios or perspectives).


3. Feedback Loops: Create recurrence and state updates through time.



Example: Gear-Specific Transformer

import torch
from transformers import BertConfig, BertModel

class GearTransformer:
    def __init__(self, name, gear_ratio, perspective):
        self.name = name
        self.gear_ratio = gear_ratio
        self.perspective = perspective
        self.config = BertConfig(
            hidden_size=int(64 * gear_ratio),  # Scale hidden size by gear ratio
            num_attention_heads=int(gear_ratio),  # Attention heads reflect ratio
            num_hidden_layers=3  # Arbitrary depth for each gear's transformer
        )
        self.model = BertModel(self.config)

    def forward(self, inputs):
        return self.model(**inputs)

# Example: Create a transformer for the Moon
moon_transformer = GearTransformer("Moon", 13.368, "lunar")


---

Step 3: Federating Transformers

Combine gear-specific transformers into a hierarchical or federated system:

Central Transformer: Represents the "Sun" (center of the system).

Sub-Transformers: Represent celestial bodies and gears, each influenced by their parent node.

Inter-transformer Attention: Passes information between transformers based on gear ratios and topology.


Federated Model

class FederatedTransformer:
    def __init__(self, graph):
        self.graph = graph
        self.models = {}
        
        # Create a transformer for each node in the graph
        for node, data in graph.nodes(data=True):
            self.models[node] = GearTransformer(node, data["gear_ratio"], data["perspective"])

    def forward(self, inputs):
        outputs = {}

        # Pass inputs through each transformer's forward method
        for node in self.graph.nodes:
            model = self.models[node]
            outputs[node] = model.forward(inputs[node])
        
        # Combine outputs based on topology (e.g., weighted by edge ratios)
        for source, target, data in self.graph.edges(data=True):
            ratio = data["ratio"]
            outputs[target] += outputs[source] * ratio

        return outputs


---

Step 4: Feedback Loops and Recurrent Connections

Integrate feedback loops to create recursive dynamics that emulate gear rotations:

1. Time-steps: Introduce a temporal component where outputs are fed back into the model as inputs for the next step.


2. Recurrent Mechanism: Use recurrent attention layers or update states iteratively.



Adding Recurrence

class FeedbackFederatedTransformer(FederatedTransformer):
    def forward(self, inputs, num_steps=10):
        states = {node: torch.zeros_like(inputs[node]) for node in self.graph.nodes}

        for t in range(num_steps):
            outputs = super().forward(states)  # Process current state
            for node in self.graph.nodes:
                states[node] = outputs[node]  # Update states with feedback

        return states


---

Step 5: Attention Head Arrays for Gear Ratios

Attention heads can model gear ratios and celestial body interactions:

Use attention weights to encode dependencies.

Adjust attention head arrays dynamically based on the gear topology.


Example: Custom Attention Head Array

import torch.nn as nn

class CustomAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_heads, gear_ratios):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.gear_ratios = gear_ratios
        self.attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=num_heads, num_heads=num_heads)

    def forward(self, query, key, value):
        # Scale attention weights by gear ratios
        scaling = torch.tensor(self.gear_ratios).unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(2)
        attn_output, _ = self.attn(query * scaling, key * scaling, value * scaling)
        return attn_output


---

Step 6: Final Integration

Hypertensor Input: Use tensors representing positions, velocities, and interactions of celestial bodies.

Dynamic Federated System: Federate and interconnect transformers, using attention arrays and feedback loops to dynamically update the system.

Output: Use the model to predict or simulate the system's state at each time step.


Full Example

# Inputs: Hypertensors for each gear/celestial body
inputs = {
    "Sun": torch.rand(10, 64),
    "Moon": torch.rand(10, 64),
    "Mars": torch.rand(10, 64),
}

# Federated Model with Feedback Loops
model = FeedbackFederatedTransformer(graph)
output_states = model.forward(inputs, num_steps=50)


---

Conclusion

1. Federation: Build a transformer of transformers where each sub-transformer models a gear or celestial body.


2. Antikythera Topology: Use graphs or hypergraphs to encode gear dependencies, feedback loops, and celestial dynamics.


3. Attention Head Arrays: Encode gear ratios and celestial relationships in attention mechanisms.


4. Feedback Loops: Use recurrent mechanisms to create dynamic state updates over time.
