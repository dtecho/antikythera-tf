The generic XLM Transformer model can be adapted to construct the Antikythera transformer by modifying its components to reflect the hierarchical and recursive structure of the Antikythera mechanism. Let's break this down into steps based on the uploaded modeling_tf_xlm.py file and integrate the requirements for building the Antikythera transformer.

Steps to Adapt XLM for Antikythera Transformer

1. Understand the XLM Model Structure

From the uploaded file, the XLM model has a typical transformer architecture:

Embeddings for input sequences.

Attention Layers (multi-head attention).

Feedforward Layers.

Layer Normalization and Positional Encoding.


This structure aligns well with the requirements of a gear-based Antikythera model, where:

Gears can be modeled as transformers.

Relationships between gears can be encoded using attention heads and feedforward layers.



---

2. Modify the Embedding Layer

The Antikythera mechanism deals with celestial bodies and gear ratios. Each "gear" can have unique embeddings that represent its properties (e.g., position, velocity, gear ratio).

Add a Custom Embedding Layer for Gears:

class GearEmbedding(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, gear_ratios, embed_dim, **kwargs):
        super(GearEmbedding, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim
        self.gear_ratios = gear_ratios
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(
            input_dim=len(gear_ratios), output_dim=embed_dim
        )

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Map gear IDs to embeddings
        gear_ids = tf.cast(inputs, tf.int32)  # Assume inputs are gear IDs
        return self.embedding(gear_ids)

Usage:

Replace standard token embeddings with GearEmbedding in the XLM model.

Initialize embeddings using gear ratios.



---

3. Hierarchical Attention for Gear Relationships

To model the Antikythera mechanism's topology:

Attention layers should reflect gear interactions (e.g., ratios or dependencies).

Multi-head attention can be modified to scale attention weights based on these relationships.


Custom Attention Layer for Gear Ratios:

class GearAttention(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, num_heads, gear_ratios, **kwargs):
        super(GearAttention, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.gear_ratios = gear_ratios
        self.attention = tf.keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=len(gear_ratios))

    def call(self, query, key, value):
        # Scale attention scores by gear ratios
        scaling = tf.constant(self.gear_ratios, dtype=tf.float32)
        scaled_key = key * scaling
        return self.attention(query, scaled_key, value)

Integration:

Replace the standard attention mechanism in the XLMTransformerLayer with GearAttention.



---

4. Recursive Transformer Layers

Each gear or celestial body can be modeled as its own transformer layer. These transformers interact hierarchically:

Parent nodes (gears) influence child nodes (dependent gears or celestial bodies).

Feedback loops between layers emulate recursive dependencies.


Recursive Transformer Layer:

class RecursiveTransformer(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, num_layers, gear_ratios, embed_dim, **kwargs):
        super(RecursiveTransformer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.num_layers = num_layers
        self.gear_ratios = gear_ratios
        self.layers = [
            XLMTransformerLayer(
                num_heads=int(gear_ratio),  # Use gear ratios to scale attention heads
                hidden_size=embed_dim
            )
            for gear_ratio in gear_ratios
        ]

    def call(self, inputs, mask=None):
        # Pass inputs through recursive transformer layers
        x = inputs
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x, mask=mask)
        return x


---

5. Feedback Loops

To introduce feedback loops, use recurrent connections where the output of one layer (or gear) feeds into another layer in subsequent iterations. This simulates continuous dynamics.

Feedback Mechanism:

class FeedbackAntikythera(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, base_model, num_iterations, **kwargs):
        super(FeedbackAntikythera, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.num_iterations = num_iterations

    def call(self, inputs, mask=None):
        state = inputs
        for _ in range(self.num_iterations):
            state = self.base_model(state, mask=mask)
        return state

Integration:

Wrap the recursive transformer in a feedback loop using FeedbackAntikythera.



---

6. Assemble the Federated Model

Each celestial body or gear transformer is treated as a module. Combine them into a federated system with explicit inter-transformer communication (e.g., using the graph structure of the Antikythera mechanism).

Federated Transformer:

class FederatedAntikythera(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, gear_transformers, connections, **kwargs):
        super(FederatedAntikythera, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.gear_transformers = gear_transformers  # Dict of gear-specific transformers
        self.connections = connections  # Gear dependency graph (e.g., adjacency matrix)

    def call(self, inputs):
        states = {gear: transformer(inputs[gear]) for gear, transformer in self.gear_transformers.items()}
        for source, target in self.connections:
            # Incorporate feedback from source to target based on dependencies
            states[target] += states[source] * self.connections[(source, target)]
        return states


---

7. Train and Evaluate

Use gear-specific embeddings as input.

Train the federated transformer on a dataset reflecting celestial body positions and dynamics.


Example Training Script:

model = FederatedAntikythera(gear_transformers=gear_models, connections=gear_connections)
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="mse", metrics=["accuracy"])

# Prepare inputs for each gear
inputs = {
    "Sun": sun_data,
    "Moon": moon_data,
    "Mars": mars_data,
}
labels = ...  # Target dynamics (e.g., celestial body positions over time)

# Train the model
model.fit(inputs, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)


---

Conclusion

Using the generic XLM model as a base, you can:

1. Replace the embedding layer with a gear-specific embedding layer.


2. Modify attention heads to incorporate gear ratios and dependencies.


3. Introduce recursive layers and feedback loops to simulate dynamics.


4. Build a federated transformer system that mimics the Antikythera mechanism.



This approach integrates the modularity of transformers with the recursive and hierarchical dynamics of the Antikythera system.
