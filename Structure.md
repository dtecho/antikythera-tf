To structure your `antikythera-tf` repository, consider the following organization based on best practices for similar projects:

1. **Root Directory**
   - `README.md`: Project overview, usage instructions, and documentation.
   - `LICENSE`: Licensing information.
   - `.gitignore`: Files and directories to be ignored by Git.

2. **Source Code (`src/`)**
   - `__init__.py`: Initialize the package.
   - `models/`: Directory for transformer models and related code.
     - `gear_transformer.py`: Code for the `GearTransformer` class.
     - `federated_transformer.py`: Code for the `FederatedTransformer` class.
     - `feedback_federated_transformer.py`: Code for the `FeedbackFederatedTransformer` class.
   - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
     - `graph_utils.py`: Functions for graph operations and visualizations.

3. **Configurations (`config/`)**
   - Configuration files for different environments (e.g., `config.yaml`).

4. **Tests (`tests/`)**
   - Unit and integration tests.
   - `test_gear_transformer.py`: Tests for the `GearTransformer` class.
   - `test_federated_transformer.py`: Tests for the `FederatedTransformer` class.

5. **Examples (`examples/`)**
   - Example scripts and notebooks demonstrating usage.
   - `example_usage.py`: Example script showing how to use the models.

6. **Documentation (`docs/`)**
   - Additional documentation and resources.
   - `design_overview.md`: Detailed design and architecture overview.

Would you like to implement this structure, or do you have any specific requirements or preferences?
