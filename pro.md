Detailed Explanation

1. Core Code: src/

models/:

Contains all the transformer-related files.

Split into components (federated_transformer.py, gear_transformer.py, feedback_transformer.py) for modularity.

custom_attention.py holds any custom attention mechanisms you implement (e.g., gear ratio-specific attention).


utils/:

Utility functions for handling hypergraphs, visualization, and serialization.

Examples:

hypergraph.py: Build, query, and manipulate hypergraph structures.

serialization.py: Save and load the hypergraph or model structure.

visualization.py: Use libraries like matplotlib or networkx for visualizing the hypergraph.



data/:

Handles all data-related operations, including preprocessing and loading.

Examples:

dataset.py: Custom PyTorch Dataset class to feed data into the model.

preprocess.py: Steps for tokenization, normalization, or any custom preprocessing.



training/:

Encapsulates the training pipeline and tools.

Examples:

trainer.py: Handles the logic of training, such as loops, logging, and saving models.

config.py: Stores model and training configuration defaults.





---

2. Testing: tests/

Unit and integration tests for:

Models (test_models.py).

Utility functions (test_utils.py).

Training pipeline (test_training.py).


Use pytest or unittest for the test suite.



---

3. Notebooks: notebooks/

Interactive notebooks for:

Visualizing hypergraphs.

Testing components like the federated transformer or gear transformers.

Debugging training or inference.


These can help collaborators or users understand and experiment with the system.



---

4. Configurations: config/

Store all configuration files (JSON format recommended) for:

Models: Layer sizes, attention heads, and depth.

Training: Hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and optimizer settings.

Hypergraph: Initial properties for building the Antikythera topology.



---

5. Data: data/

Organize data for:

Raw data: Unprocessed files.

Processed data: Cleaned data ready for training and testing.



---

6. Documentation: docs/

Comprehensive documentation to guide new users or collaborators:

Architecture: Explain the federated transformer and its components.

Hypergraph Representation: Details of the hypergraph used to represent Antikythera.

Training Pipeline: How to train, evaluate, and fine-tune the model.

API Reference: Document all classes, functions, and methods.



---

7. Scripts: scripts/

Standalone scripts for common tasks:

train.py: Train the model.

evaluate.py: Evaluate performance on test data.

infer.py: Run inference using a trained model.

preprocess_data.py: Preprocess raw datasets into usable formats.



---

8. Project Metadata

environment.yml:

Use this for a Conda environment file if working with Conda.


requirements.txt:

Specify Python dependencies, e.g.:

torch
transformers
networkx
matplotlib
numpy


setup.py:

Package the project for installation with pip.




---

9. README and License

README.md:

Overview of the project, including setup instructions and usage.


LICENSE:

Specify the license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).




---

Key Points

1. Modularity:

Keep components (e.g., models, training logic, utilities) in separate files for clarity.



2. Reusability:

Encapsulate common logic (e.g., hypergraph manipulation) in utilities.



3. Documentation and Testing:

Write thorough documentation and unit tests to ensure reliability and extensibility.
